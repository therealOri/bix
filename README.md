# bix
A very simple and real disboard auto bumber without using discords api. Which means you can't get banned for abusing their api as it's not a selfbot.






# Installation
If you get a module not found error type `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install missing modules.

The only other thing you need is python3 itself. (Pip is already included on instalation on windows.)
You can find, download, and install python3 from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

If you are on windows use this: [download](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.4/python-3.9.4-amd64.exe)




# Usage
You can manually set whatever you want to be sent to the channel after running the file, it's very easy to use.
All you really have to do is set up the timing for when you want messages to be sent and how long to wait. Everything is in seconds so keep that in mind when messing with the time.

You will also NEED to have the chat box of wherever you are using this clicked on for text to be typed there. Otherwise it will just type your stuff in the cmd/terminal window.
